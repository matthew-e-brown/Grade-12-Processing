This is a file with text in it.
I don't know what to really put in this file.
I'm just going to use this for testing file encryption.

Here is the first paragraph from a random wikipedia article:

The A5 motorway (Slovene: avtocesta A5, Pomurski krak) of Slovenia is 79.6 km long.
It begins at the Dragucova interchange on the A1 motorway north of Maribor and ends at the
Hungarian border at Pince, continuing on in Hungary as the M70 motorway.
It connects Maribor with Budapest.
